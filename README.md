Political Deepfake Detection Research
This repository focuses on the detection and prevention of political deepfakesâ€”AI-generated media used to mislead and manipulate public opinion during elections and political campaigns. As deepfakes become more sophisticated, they pose a growing threat to democratic processes by spreading misinformation and eroding trust in media. This project aims to develop and share tools, datasets, and algorithms to improve the detection and mitigation of these threats.

Overview
Deepfakes are synthetic media created using AI technologies, capable of altering video, audio, or images to misrepresent individuals. This repository addresses the pressing challenge of detecting and counteracting deepfakes in political contexts by:

Developing Detection Algorithms: Implementing and optimizing AI-based models to identify deepfakes in video, audio, and multimodal media.
Curating Datasets: Providing labeled datasets tailored for training and evaluating detection systems.
Enhancing Democratic Integrity: Supporting research and tools that safeguard elections from manipulation.
